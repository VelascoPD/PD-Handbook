POLICY[/size][/centre]
[hr][/hr]
[b][u]010. POLICY.[/u][/b] 
Policy consists of principles and values which guide the performance of a Department activity. Policy is not a statement of what must be done in a particular situation; rather, it is a statement of guiding principles which should be followed in activities which are directed toward the attainment of Department objectives. Policy is formulated by analyzing objectives and determining through research those principles which will best guide the Department in achieving its objectives. Policy is based upon police ethics and experience, the desires of the community, and the mandate of the law. 
Policy is articulated to inform the public and Department employees of the principles which will be adhered to in the performance of the law enforcement function. Additionally, policy establishes operational standards to assist Department employees in
the necessary exercise of discretion in discharging their responsibility. An officer in the performance of his duty is confronted with an infinite variety of complex situations which require police action. Since policy is objective rather than situation oriented, it is broad enough in scope to encompass most situations. Policy, therefore, must be stated in general terms.

[b][u]020. GLOSSARY[/u][/b]
[b]020.10 VALUE[/b]. A value is a quality of performance or accomplishment. Values are the basis for the determination of objectives and may be both ethical and functional.
[b]020.20 OBJECTIVE[/b].
An objective is a desired end for which effort is expended, and which, if attained, fulfills the purposes of the Department. Within each objective, there may be a number of ancillary objectives, each of which, if attained, contributes to the accomplishment of the police mission.
[b]020.30 PRINCIPLE. [/b]A principle is a conceptual guide arrived at through logical deduction by evaluating experience with a view toward the attainment of objectives. A principle may be of assistance in the exercise of judgment in a duty-related activity and may be both ethical and functional.
[b]020.40 PROCEDURE.[/b] A procedure is a method of performing an operation or a manner of proceeding on a course of action. It differs from policy in that it directs action in a particular situation to perform a specific task within the guidelines of policy. Both policies and procedures are objective oriented; however, policy establishes limits of action while procedure directs response within those limits.
[b]020.50 RULE.[/b] A rule is a specific prohibition or requirement which is stated to prevent deviations from policy or procedure. Rules allow little deviation other than for stated exceptions.

[b][u]100. MOTTO OF THE DEPARTMENT.[/u][/b]

The Department protects the right of all persons within its jurisdiction to be free from criminal attack, to be secure in their possessions, and to live in peace.

[divbox=black][size=150][centre][color=#FFFFFF]LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS[/color][/centre][/size][/divbox]
[b][u]210. CALLED FOR SERVICES.[/u][/b]
[b]210.10 PRIORITY OF HANDLING CALLS FOR SERVICE. [/b]
It is not always possible for the Department to respond to every call for service; therefore, the Department must organize available resources to give the highest level of efficient service possible. Priority of call assignment depends on many factors, and it is normally the responsibility
of a supervisor to make such assignments; however, an officer in the field may be required to decide whether to continue on an assigned call or handle a citizen's complaint or other observed event and cause his call to be reassigned. Such determination should be based upon the comparative urgency and the risk to life and property of the assigned call and the intervening incident. When it is impossible for an officer to handle a citizen's complaint or an observed event, the officer should, if circumstances permit, either give directions for obtaining such assistance or initiate the necessary notifications himself/herself.

[b][u]220. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION.[/u][/b]
[b]220.10 SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION. [/b]The scope of preliminary investigation by a uniformed officer may be very restricted or it may constitute the entire investigation of the crime. In a particular crime, the scope of the preliminary investigation may be limited by investigative policy, and in all cases it is limited by an officer's assignment work load. Consistent with his/her other responsibilities, an officer should continue a preliminary investigation to the point where the delay in investigation caused by the report being processed will not materially jeopardize the investigation.
[b]220.20 FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION BY UNIFORMED OFFICERS. [/b]
Uniformed officers may conduct a limited follow-up investigation upon supervisory approval when there is a reasonable chance of apprehending the suspect, when there is a need for obtaining additional information for the preliminary investigation report, or when there are other compelling circumstances.

[b][u]230. FIELD SUPERVISION. [/u][/b]
Since emergency situations occur without warning, and their duration is often brief, officers must frequently make critical decisions without
benefit of on-the-scene direction. In most police operations, however, supervision is available and necessary to provide guidance and training. Supervision gives coherence to the police task and directs the energies of the Department into an organized effort. Proper supervision is essential to maintain a professional level of competence in law enforcement operations.
[b]230.10 SUPERVISION IN FIELD OPERATIONS. [/b]
The Department is an organization with an assignment of responsibility and accountability throughout the rank structure. To the degree that senior officers are responsible and accountable for the performance of their junior officers, they must be granted commensurate authority in order to properly discharge their supervisorial responsibility. Field supervision begins with senior officers of the Department, and it is upon them that the primary burden of training and supervising less experienced officers is placed. A field sergeant is the first level of full-time supervision, and it is his or her primary responsibility to guide, train, direct, and motivate those over whom he or she has control. A field sergeant is not normally expected to engage in law enforcement operations except in a command or supervisory capacity.
[b]230.20 CRIME SCENE SUPERVISION.[/b] 
The senior investigating officer present is in charge of a crime scene.

[b][u]240. INFORMANTS[/u][/b]
[b]240.10 USE OF INFORMANTS.[/b] 
Often, information from confidential sources is the investigative lead which solves a case and without which there could not be a prosecution. Information is received by the Department regarding criminal activities and suspects from persons in all walks of life. Many people who give information have been victims or witnesses of crimes, or they may have a strong desire to aid law enforcement. There are
others motivated purely by selfish interests. However, regardless of their motivation, the use of informants is a basic weapon in the fight against crime, and they are a judicially recognized source of information. An informant's motivation should be carefully evaluated in determining the extent upon which the information will be relied.
[b]240.20 INFORMANT'S IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION. [/b]
Informants will sometimes offer to exchange information for immunity or for their release. Such immunity may properly be granted by a judge in a judicial proceeding; however, neither the Department nor any of its members may grant any person immunity from prosecution.
[b]240.30 INDIVIDUAL OFFICER'S INFORMANT RESPONSIBILITIES. [/b]
Officers shall keep their supervisors informed of their relations and activities involving informants. A commanding officer shall require that the identity of informants be disclosed to him/her. At least two officers shall be present when meeting with an informant in the field and both officers should understand the informant’s language.

[b][u]250. USE OF FORCE.[/u][/b]
[b]250.10 POLICY ON THE USE OF FORCE.
PREAMBLE TO USE OF FORCE. [/b]
The use of force by members of law enforcement is a matter of critical concern both to the public and the law enforcement community. It
is recognized that some individuals will not comply with the law or submit to control unless compelled to do so by the use of force; therefore, law enforcement officers are sometimes called upon to use force in the performance of their duties. The Los Santos Police Department also recognizes that members of law enforcement derive their authority from the public and therefore must be ever mindful that they are not only the
guardians, but also the servants of the public. The Department’s guiding principle when using force shall be reverence for human life.
Officers shall attempt to control an incident by using time, distance, communications, and available resources in an effort to de-escalate the situation, whenever it is safe, feasible, and reasonable to do so. As stated below, when warranted, Department personnel may use objectively reasonable force to carry out their duties. Officers may use deadly force only when they reasonably believe, based on the totality of
circumstances, that such force is necessary in defense of human life. Officers who use unreasonable force degrade the confidence of the community we serve, expose fellow officers to physical hazards, violate the law and rights of individuals upon whom unreasonable force or unnecessary deadly force is used, and subject the Department and themselves to potential civil and criminal liability. Conversely, officers who fail to use force when warranted may endanger themselves, the community and fellow officers.

[b]Use of De-Escalation Techniques.[/b] 
It is the policy of this Department that, whenever feasible, officers shall use techniques and tools consistent with department de-escalation training to reduce the intensity of any encounter with a suspect and enable an officer to have additional options to mitigate the need to use a higher level of force while maintaining control of the situation.
[b]Verbal Warnings.[/b] 
Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of any force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and to warn that force may be used, unless the officer has objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the person is aware of those facts.
[b]Proportionality.[/b]
Officers may only use a level of force that they reasonably believe is proportional to the seriousness of the suspected offense or the reasonably perceived level of actual or threatened resistance.
[b]Fair and Unbiased Policing. [/b]
Officers shall carry out their duties, including use of force, in a manner that is fair and unbiased. Discriminatory conduct on the basis of race,
religion, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, housing status, or disability while performing any law enforcement activity is prohibited.

[b]Use of Force - Non-Deadly. [/b]
It is the policy of this Department that personnel may use only that force which is "objectively reasonable" to:
[list]Defend themselves;
[*]Defend others;
[*]Effect an arrest or detention;
[*]Prevent escape; or,
[*]Overcome resistance.[/list]

[b]Drawing or Exhibiting Firearms. [/b]
Unnecessarily or prematurely drawing or exhibiting a firearm limits an officer’s alternatives in controlling a situation, creates unnecessary anxiety on the part of citizens, and may result in an unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm. Officers shall not draw or exhibit a firearm unless the circumstances surrounding the incident create a reasonable belief that it may be necessary to use the firearm. When an officer has determined that the use of deadly force is not necessary, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, secure or holster the firearm. Any drawing and exhibiting of a firearm shall conform with this policy on the use of firearms. Moreover, any intentional pointing of a firearm at a person by an officer shall be reported. Such reporting will be published in the Department’s year-end use of force report.

[b]Use of Force - Deadly. [/b]
It is the policy of this Department that officers shall use deadly
force upon another person only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the
totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary for either of the following reasons:
[list]To defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person; or,
[*]To apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended.[/list]

In determining whether deadly force is necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case and shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible. Before discharging a firearm, officers shall consider their surroundings and potential risks to bystanders to the extent reasonable under the circumstances.

[b]Rendering Aid.[/b] After any use of force, officers shall immediately request a rescue ambulance for any person injured. In addition, officers shall promptly provide basic and emergency medical assistance to all members of the community, including victims, witnesses, subjects, suspects, persons in custody, subjects of a use of force and fellow officers:
[list]To the extent of the officer’s training and experience in first aid/CPR/AED; and,
[*]To the level of equipment available to an officer at the time assistance is needed.[/list]

[b]Warning Shots[/b]. 
It is the policy of this Department that warning shots shall only be used in exceptional circumstances where it might reasonably be expected to avoid the need to use deadly force. Generally, warning shots shall be directed in a manner that minimizes the risk of injury to innocent persons, ricochet dangers and property damage.

[b]Shooting at or From Moving Vehicles.[/b] 
It is the policy of this Department that firearms shall not be discharged at a moving vehicle unless a person in the vehicle is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle. The moving vehicle itself shall not presumptively constitute a threat that justifies an officer’s use of deadly force. An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall move out of its path instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants. Firearms shall not be discharged from a moving vehicle, except in exigent circumstances and consistent with this policy in regard to the use of Deadly Force.

[b][u]020. NUMBERING SYSTEM USED IN THE DEPARTMENT MANUAL. [/u][/b]
A modified decimal system is used to number each volume, chapter, section, and subsection of the Department Manual in order to provide quick reference to all material, to afford an easy means of citing specific subjects, and to maintain the flexibility of format necessary to facilitate expansion and revision of its contents.
A typical reference under the decimal system used in the Department Manual would be "2/360.56." The number (2) preceding the diagonal line (solidus) indicates that the material is contained in the second volume of the Manual. The "360.56" conveys several facts:
[list]First, that the material is in Chapter 3 (2/360.56).
[*]Next, that it is in Section 60 of Chapter 3 (2/360.56).
[*]Finally, that it is located in the paragraph designated as .56 (2/360.56).
[*]This reference is read as "two, three-sixty, point fifty-six."
